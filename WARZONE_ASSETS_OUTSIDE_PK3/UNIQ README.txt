Hey m8, i just got my weapons from DT and now i wanted to test them out, but you have done somthing to glsl stuff again, and im getting compiler errors like
does i had before, you are even going over some limits here or have fucked somthing up in there.
i can't not play, there is no ui for joinging game, and if im getting lucky with it i can't see over half of the weapons and there is no effects

come online soon so we can talk, i have some good ideas, and i think you should leave that rend2 stuff alone, as Xyc not is doing anything for it anytime soon.
fuck things even more up destroys the gameplay :)
